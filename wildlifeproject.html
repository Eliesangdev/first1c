    <div><h3>lion</h3>
        <p>Lion monitoring: Very little was known about the population dynamics or threats to  lions in MFNP until the start of the WCS lion-monitoring project in 2009.
             This built upon previous work conducted by UWA veterinary doctor Margaret Driciru in 2001.</p>

    <div><h3>gorilla</h3>
        <p>Mountain gorillas are very well protected in Uganda because of their importance for tourism.
             Mountain gorilla tourism generates more foreign currency than any other activity in Uganda today. Proceeds from gorilla tourism support the conservation of most of the other National Parks and Reserves in Uganda.</p>

    <div><h3>crocodile</h3>
        <p>Crocodiles have been around for a very long time in Africa and many legends exist about them in African folklore.
              They mostly live in protected areas these days because outside they are hunted by people because of the threat they pose to human life.</p>

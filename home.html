       <div><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <P>Uganda is one of the richest countries in Africa for biodiversity conservation, ranking second richest for mammals (and 13th in the World), second for birds, and seventh for higher plants. This is because several major Biomes meet here, each with their associated fauna and flora. Uganda is also home to several species whose global range is mostly confined to Uganda, such as mountain gorillas, Rothschild giraffe, Uganda mangabey, and Nahanâ€™s francolin. Several wetland areas are also protected under Uganda law and managed by Wetlands Division of the Ministry of Environment.with low population sizes or are declining in number. In order to do this we have to address many challenges that include poaching of wildlife,habitat loss to agriculture,  competing land uses and the recent oil developments in the country.This web site summarises what WCS Uganda is achieving with its partners and some of 
            the key needs for conservation in this amazingly beautiful country.</P><br>
